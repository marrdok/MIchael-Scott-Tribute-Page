          <strong>Inspiration</strong><br />
          His role models are Bob Hope, Abraham Lincoln, Bono, and God. Yes, you
          read that right. He goes on to say, “And I just think all those people
          really helped the world in so many ways that it’s … it’s really beyond
          words. It’s really incalculable”

          <strong>I Scream for Ice Cream!</strong><br />
          His favorite flavor of ice cream is mint chocolate chip. When he finds
          out Meredith is allergic to dairy and can’t have any of the ice cream
          cake he forced Angela to buy for her birthday, he says, “If I was
          allergic to dairy, I think I would kill myself. It’s too good.”

          His birthday is March 15 and he was born at exactly 11:23 a.m. He
          makes sure to point out that he shares the date with Eva Longoria, so
          he’ll have something to discuss with Teri Hatcher if they ever meet.

          <strong>Where Do Lonely Hearts Go?</strong><br />

          allowed unlimited calls to his top five friends, he doesn’t even have
          five friends to add. Cue the awwws
